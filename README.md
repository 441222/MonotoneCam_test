# MonotoneCamApp

MonotoneCamApp is a simple, elegant iOS camera application developed using SwiftUI. It's designed to capture photos and automatically apply a monochrome filter, offering users a unique and artistic take on their photographs.

## Features

- **Camera Preview**: Provides a live camera feed, allowing users to frame their shots before capturing.
- **Countdown Timer**: Initiates a 3-second countdown upon pressing the capture button, enhancing the photo-taking experience.
- **Monochrome Processing**: Automatically applies a monochromatic filter to the captured photo.
- **Photo Preview**: Offers a preview of the final monochrome photo before saving it to the photo library.
